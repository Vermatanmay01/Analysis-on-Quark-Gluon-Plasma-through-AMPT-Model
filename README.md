# Simulating the Bulk Properties of Quark-Gluon Plasma Using the AMPT Model


These codes are for determining the transverse momentum distributions for the particles present in the root files.
These distributions are obtained for STAR energies(7.7, 11.5, 19.6, 27 and 39).
For successfull execution of the all codes I have also uploaded some root files for 7.7 Gev energies at different centralities.
